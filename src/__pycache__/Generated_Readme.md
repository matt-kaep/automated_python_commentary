# Project Title
Python Docstring and README Generator

This project is a Python-based utility that automates the generation of docstrings for Python files and README files for directories. It also has the capability to generate advisory files.

## About
The project consists of two main Python files: `main1.py` and `utils1.py`. 

`main1.py` is the main driver of the project. It contains a function that performs various tasks based on the provided arguments. These tasks include generating and adding docstrings to Python files, generating README files, and generating advisory files.

`utils1.py` contains several utility functions that are used by `main1.py`. These functions include parsing Python files to extract function definitions, extracting key elements from a Python file, modifying Python files to insert docstrings, and sending code to ChatGPT for completion.

The `Generated_Readme.md` is an example of a README file generated by this project.

The `utils.cpython-311.pyc` and `utils1.cpython-311.pyc` are compiled Python files for the `utils.py` and `utils1.py` scripts respectively.

## Getting Started
To get this project up and running on your local machine, you will need to have Python installed.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- An internet connection for sending code to ChatGPT

### Installing
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `main1.py` script with the appropriate arguments.

### Running the project
To run the project, navigate to the project directory and run the `main1.py` script with the appropriate arguments. For example:

```bash
python main1.py --root_dir ./my_project --docstring_bool True --Readme_bool True --advisory_bool True
```

## Usage
This project can be used to automatically generate docstrings for Python files and README files for directories. It can also generate advisory files. This can be useful for maintaining documentation and providing information about the code and directories in a project.
